Here are a number of tools that you may find useful:

* [Github](https://github.com) is an online source code hosting platform that utilises the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system. If you're working in a government space, the [Github and Government](https://github.com/government/welcome) site is recommended.
* [ogr2ogr](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries) is a part of the GDAL library which can be used to translate between a number of geospatial formats, such as Esri Shapefile to GeoJSON. If you are unable to install binaries on your system, there is also an unofficial online interface called [OGRE](https://github.com/wavded/ogre). For more information and examples, [this post](http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/31-GDAL-OGR2OGR-for-Data-Loading.html) is worth checking out.
* [Octopub](https://octopub.io/) is a site which connects with Github and provides a simple interface for uploading CSV tabular datasets for those who aren't experienced with Git or Github.
* [CKAN](http://ckan.org) is an open source data management system aimed at governments, companies and organisations want a quick way to openly provide datasets to the public. It also comes with API support baked in, allowing automated upload tools to be built by more tech savvy members of your organisation.
