There are a number of Open Source tools that you may find useful:

* [ogr2ogr](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries) is a part of the GDAL library which can be used to translate between a number of open formats. In particular, it can convert ESRI files to an open format like GeoJSON. If you are unable to install binaries on your system, there is also an online interface called [OGRE](https://github.com/wavded/ogre).
