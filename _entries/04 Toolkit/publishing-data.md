_This guide will be likely be most useful to IT managers, GIS coordinators, asset managers and database admin strators._
The focus of this guide will be generic, easily uploadable datasets such as PDFs, CSVs, spreadsheets and so on.

Larger, more complex datasets, eg; geospatial will likely be unable to utilise [data.govt.nz](https://data.govt.nz) for storage and may prefer to look into their own hosting solutions.

You will still be able to index larger datasets in the data.govt.nz search engine, it's just that the resource will be located on an external service.

The general process for uploading a dataset is as follows:

1. Identify datasets to publish
2. For each dataset:
  1. Export the data and ensure it is cleaned, raw data
  2. Upload the dataset to data.govt.nz, providing metadata and choosing an appropriate license
3. Schedule regular updates
