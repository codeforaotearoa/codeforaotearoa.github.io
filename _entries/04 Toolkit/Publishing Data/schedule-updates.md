It's important to keep a schedule of how often the datasets you have released are updated. Some datasets may not need updating very often but others, such as weekly petrol prices, will be at their peak usefulness should they be updated in a timely manner.

For the example of petrol prices, it wouldn't make sense to only update the dataset once a month and interested users would likely look somewhere else for fresher data.
