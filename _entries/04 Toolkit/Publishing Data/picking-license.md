Licensing an important aspect of releasing your dataset. It will determine whether or not anyone actually has permission to reuse your dataset, let alone redistribute it or use it for a commercial purpose. It also specifies whether others have to provide attribution to you for your work.

In New Zealand, the [NZGOAL framework](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/) provides guidance for agencies to follow when releasing copyright works and non-copyright material for re-use by others.

Once you've successfully listed your dataset on [data.govt.nz](data.govt.nz), you should be able to see the listing in the catalogue once it has been moderated by DIA:
