Licensing is easily the most important aspect of releasing your dataset. It will determine whether or not your dataset can be used for a commercial purpose, publically redistributed and/or whether or not others have to provide attribution for your work.

For assistance in deciding, you may wish to consult the [NZGOAL framework](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/) which provides guidance for agencies to follow when releasing copyright works and non-copyright material for re-use by others.

Once you've successfully uploaded your dataset, you should be able to see it live like so in the catalogue:
