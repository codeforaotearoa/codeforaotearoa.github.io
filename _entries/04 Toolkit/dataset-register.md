Keeping a simple dataset register helps track what data assets your organisation has, and their status in the pipeline towards eventual release as open data.

The main points to focus on are:

* **Where** is the data managed?
  - Who "owns" it?
  - What system is it in?
  - Which unit does it fall under?
  - Is it already published?

* **Technical Attributes**
  - Is it spatial or tabular?
  - How many attributes are there?
  - How often is it updated?

* **Value to the public**
  - What are its potential uses?
  - Are there comparable datasets?
  - How unique is the data?

* **Progress towards being published**
  - Does the data need cleaning?
  - Has all confidential information been removed?
  - Does it need transforming to meet an Open Data standard?
  - Are all approvals obtained?
