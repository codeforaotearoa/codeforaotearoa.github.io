A key avenue for generating initial buy-in from leadership is to show how embracing open data can drive progress on high priority issues. You should consider how open data can support the priorities of high-level policies that are relevant to your context.

It could be aiding in creating jobs, reducing vacant and abandoned properties, or increasing government transparency. The way you pitch your Open Data plan can help get some quick wins under your belt and get on your way to a longer-term initiative.

You may find it useful to review recent high-profile speeches and statements from your agency leadership to identify some potential key issues your initiative may assist with.

Don't be afraid to be creative with your solutions as open data can have impact in the most unexpected areas.
