title: Defining the goals of your Open Data initiative
number: 3100
---

Your Open Data initiative should align with the larger strategic goals and objectives that your organisation strives towards. It may be tempting to "do open data" for the sake of it but in order to have the longest possible impact, you should have a greater goal in mind.

You should be clear from the beginning as you define your Open Data goals. This will aid your team immensely when articulating your vision to potential stakeholders.

You should ask yourself
  - What makes Open Data important for your agency?
  - What would a successful Open Data initiative look like?
  - What existing needs and priorities does your organisation have, that can be supported by Open Data?

For example: 
Public trust and confidence and being able to work closely with well-informed communities are two things critical to Police. Open data is now a key contributor to Police achieving both these goals.
