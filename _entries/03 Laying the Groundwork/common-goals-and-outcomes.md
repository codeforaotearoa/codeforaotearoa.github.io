Depending on the values, priorities and resources afforded to your Open Data initiative, you may have a single goal or multiple. Here are some examples of common goals:

  - Saving staff hours through increased sharing of information between departments.
  - Enabling citizens to gain a better understanding of government activity, promoting economic development and improving quality of life.
  - Providing greater availability, and awareness, of data used in data-driven decision-making.
  - Providing a basis for a local civic technology ecosystem.
  - Reducing the volume of incoming [Official Information Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html) requests by making highly requested, non-sensitive information available in a self-serve format.
