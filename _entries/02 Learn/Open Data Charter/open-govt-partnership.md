The [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/) is a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. In the spirit of multi-stakeholder collaboration, OGP is overseen by a Steering Committee including representatives of governments and civil society organizations.

To become a member of OGP, participating countries must endorse a high-level [Open Government Declaration](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration), deliver a country action plan developed with public consultation, and commit to independent reporting on their progress going forward.
