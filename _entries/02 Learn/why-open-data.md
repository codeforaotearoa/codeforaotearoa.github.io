Releasing Open Data is not easy. It requires time and resources and it can also be a challenge to make sure the fine line between transparency and privacy isn't compromised.
So if it is so challenging and requires money, then the question is : Is it worth it?

Take a moment to watch this video about the potential of open data

This is just the tip of the iceberg, there is much more to this.

Some of the key areas where Open Government Data is creating value are:

- Transparency and democratic control
- Participation
- Self-empowerment
- Improved or new private products and services
- Innovation
- Improved efficiency and effectiveness of government services
- Impact measurement of policies
- New knowledge from combined data sources and patterns in large data volumes

A few examples that validate the above:

- The UK ['Where does my money go'](http://app.wheredoesmymoneygo.org//) site shows users how their tax money is being spent by government
- Canada was able to save [$3.2 billion in charity tax fraud](https://eaves.ca/2010/04/14/case-study-open-data-and-the-public-purse/).
- Various websites such as the Danish [folketsting.dk](folketsting.dk) tracks activity in parliament and the law making processes, so you can see what exactly is happening, and which parliamentarians are involved.

For more examples, see [here](#examples-of-open-data-usage).

In summary, key benefits of open data include:

- Promoting greater transparency and engagement between government and communities by allowing data to be analysed and visualised in unique and different ways (where government may not always have the expertise or resources to do these). This can lead to a more engaged, connected and informed community and can help highlight some of the work happening behind the scenes to collect and manage public data.
- Facilitating social and commercial innovation, by allowing the growth of new business and service models that rely on open data.
- Improving service delivery and community satisfaction by allowing citizens to interact with public government data via online interfaces or community-developed apps.

In the computer world there is something called Linus’ Law, which states: “given enough eyeballs, all bugs (problems) are shallow.” and one can draw parallels from it for almost everything.
There can also be long-term or unanticipated benefits to opening data. This is because it is not always possible to predict the kinds of innovation that may evolve in response to the release of open data.
