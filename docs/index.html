                    <h1>Intro to the Open Data Tool Kit</h1>
                

            <p>The Open Data Toolkit is designed to help governments and open data enthusiasts understand the basic concepts of Open Data, then in planning and implementing an open government data program and some tricks on how to approach a dataset.</p>

<p>Getting started with Open Data can be easier than many people think. If you have data in a re-usable electronic form, a publicly accessible domain to put it and an open license, then you’re on the right path.</p>

<p>This toolkit provides a comprehensive step by step approach to help government agencies release more open data in a simplified manner.</p>

                    <h2>What is Open Data?</h2>
                

            <p>What is Open Data?</p>

<p>According to Open Data Institute, “Open data is data that anyone can access, use or share. Simple as that. When big companies or governments release non-personal data, it enables small businesses, citizens and medical researchers to develop resources which make crucial improvements to their communities.”</p>

<p>What is Open Government Data?</p>

<p>Open government data means:</p>

<p>Data produced or commissioned by government or government controlled entities
Data which is open as defined in the Open Definition – that is, it can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone.</p>

<p>What is good Open Data?</p>

<p>// need to think of an alternative question.</p>

<p>What is machine readable data?</p>

<p>Data in a data format that can be automatically read and processed by a computer, such as CSV, JSON, XML, etc. Machine-readable data must be structured data.</p>

<p>Some human-readable formats, such as PDF, are not machine-readable as they are not structured data, i.e. the representation of the data on disk does not represent the actual relationships present in the data.</p>

                    <h2>Why Open Data?</h2>
                

            <p>Doing Open data is not easy, requires time and resources, and also a challenge to make sure one doesn’t cross the fine line between transparency and privacy.
So if it is so challenging and requires money, then the question is : Is it worth it?</p>

<p>Watch this video by Open Data NZ team and listen to the team talk about its potentials…</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bwX5MAZ6zKI" frameborder="1" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, there is much more to this. Imagine how much more potential it has when we start talking about collaboration between different agencies and governements.</p>

<p>Some of the key areas where Open Government Data is creating value are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transparency and democratic control</li>
  <li>Participation</li>
  <li>Self-empowerment</li>
  <li>Improved or new private products and services</li>
  <li>Innovation</li>
  <li>Improved efficiency of government services</li>
  <li>Improved effectiveness of government services</li>
  <li>Impact measurement of policies</li>
  <li>New knowledge from combined data sources and patterns in large data volumes</li>
</ul>

<p>A few examples that validate the above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The [‘tax tree’] and <a href="http://app.wheredoesmymoneygo.org//">‘where does my money go’</a> are projects that show how tax money is being spent by government.</li>
  <li>And there’s the example of <a href="https://eaves.ca/2010/04/14/case-study-open-data-and-the-public-purse/">how open data saved Canada $3.2 billion in charity tax fraud</a>.</li>
  <li>Also various websites such as the Danish <a href="folketsting.dk">folketsting.dk</a> track activity in parliament and the law making processes, so you can see what exactly is happening, and which parliamentarians are involved.</li>
  <li>It also helps in making more informed personal life decisions, A woman in Denmark built website, which showed all the <a href="http://beta.findtoilet.dk/">Danish public toilets</a>, so that people she knew with bladder problems can now trust themselves to go out more again.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more examples, see <a href="#examples-of-open-data-usage">here</a>.</p>

<p>In summary, key benefits of open data include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promoting greater transparency and engagement between government and community-members by allowing scope for data to be analysed and visualised in unique and different ways (where government may not always have the expertise or resources to do so). This can lead to a more engaged, connected and informed community and can help highlight some of the work councils are doing behind the scenes to collect and manage public data.</li>
  <li>Facilitating social and commercial innovation, by allowing the growth of new business and service models that rely on open data.</li>
  <li>Improving service delivery and community satisfaction by allowing citizens to interact with public government data via online interfaces or community-developed apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the computer world there is something called Linus’ Law, which states: “given enough eyeballs, all bugs (problems) are shallow.” and one can draw parallels from it for almost everything.
There can also be long-term or unforeseen benefits in opening data. This is because it is not always possible to predict the kinds of innovation that may evolve in response to the release of open data.</p>

                    <h2>Open Data Charter and NZDIMP</h2>
                

            <p>What is International Open Data Charter?</p>

<p>The International Open Data Charter is a set of principles and best practices for the release of governmental open data.</p>

<p>The charter mandates that data released by governments comply with these <a href="http://opendatacharter.net/principles/">principles</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open by Default</li>
  <li>Timely and Comprehensive</li>
  <li>Accessible and Usable</li>
  <li>Comparable and Interoperable</li>
  <li>For Improved Governance and Citizen Engagement</li>
  <li>For Inclusive Development and Innovation</li>
</ul>

<p>The adherents to the International Open Data Charter, recognize that governments and other public sector organizations hold vast amounts of data that may be of interest to citizens, and that this data is an underused resource. Opening up government data can encourage the building of more interconnected societies that better meet the needs of our citizens and allow innovation, justice, transparency, and prosperity to flourish, all while ensuring civic participation in public decisions and accountability for governments.</p>

<p>To understand how ODC was formed, read <a href="http://opendatacharter.net/history/">here</a></p>

<p>Which Countries have adopted the charter?</p>

<p>As of October 2016, the international Open Data Charter has been adopted by 39 governments, 15 national and 24 local/subnational.</p>

<p>View the list <a href="http://opendatacharter.net/adopted-by/">here</a></p>

<p>Which organisations have endorsed the charter?</p>

<p>As of October 2016, the Open Data Charter has been endorsed by 32 organizations and non-state actors.
view the list <a href="http://opendatacharter.net/endorsed-by/">here</a></p>

<p>To adopt the charter, follow the process <a href="http://opendatacharter.net/adopt-the-charter/">here</a>
To endorse the charter, follow the process <a href="http://opendatacharter.net/endorse-the-charter/">here</a></p>

<p>What is the Open Government Partnership?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/">Open Government Partnership</a> is a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. In the spirit of multi-stakeholder collaboration, OGP is overseen by a Steering Committee including representatives of governments and civil society organizations.</p>

<p>To become a member of OGP, participating countries must endorse a high-level <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration">Open Government Declaration</a>, deliver a country action plan developed with public consultation, and commit to independent reporting on their progress going forward.</p>

<p>To learn more on how to be a member, read more <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/how-join">here</a>.</p>

<p>How is ODC related to OGP?</p>

<p>One of the agenda in the action plan for OGP is to have guidelines, for member governments, to adopt the open data charter. This is part of the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/workplan-2015-2016">action plan</a> for the year 2016.</p>

<p>What does this mean to New Zealand?</p>

<p>New Zealand Data and Information Management Principles:
The New Zealand Government has adopted a policy called <a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-data-and-information-management-principles/">New Zealand Data and Information Management Principles</a></p>

<p>The core principles of NZDIMP are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open</li>
  <li>Protected</li>
  <li>Readily available</li>
  <li>Trusted and authoritative</li>
  <li>Well managed</li>
  <li>Reasonably priced</li>
  <li>Reusable</li>
</ul>

<p>Should New Zealand adopt the charter?</p>

<p>This is not a simple question and doesn’t have a staright-forward answer. There has been a lot of discussion going on around this and to participate in this discussion and read more about it, follow the links below.</p>

            <p>It can be tough deciding how to release your code into the outside world.</p>

<p>There’s so many licenses, each all doing different things and aaah, it’s just a nightmare, right?</p>

<p>Thankfully, Open Data NZ have tackled this beast with the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing (NZGOAL) Framework.</p>

<p>Of course, you’re free to pick and choose as you like but if you feel that you need guidance in this area, it’s definitely worth a read.</p>

            <p><em>This guide will be likely be most useful to IT managers, GIS coordinators, asset managers and database admin strators.</em>
The focus of this guide will be generic, easily uploadable datasets such as PDFs, CSVs, spreadsheets and so on.</p>

<p>Larger, more complex datasets, eg; geospatial will likely be unable to utilise <a href="https://data.govt.nz">data.govt.nz</a> for storage and may prefer to look into their own hosting solutions.</p>

<p>You will still be able to index larger datasets in the data.govt.nz search engine, it’s just that the resource will be located on an external service.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/publishing-data/01-homepage.jpg" alt="Data.govt.nz homepage" /></p>

<p>The general process for uploading a dataset is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify datasets to publish</li>
  <li>For each dataset:</li>
  <li>Export the data and ensure it is cleaned, raw data</li>
  <li>Upload the dataset to data.govt.nz, providing metadata and choosing an appropriate license</li>
  <li>Schedule regular updates</li>

            <p>For the first dataset, it’s recommended that you pick something that is likely to be useful straight away. It should also be known to be of good quality as well as being free from any privacy or confidentiality issues.</p>

<p>Some examples of good starting datasets that don’t change frequently would be <strong>drain pipes, waste collection zones, dog walking zones, and customer service center locations</strong>.</p>

            <p>In order to prepare data sets to maximise their usefulness, it’s important to acknowledge the different types of formats available as well as the limitations that they may present:</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <th colspan="3">Tabular</th>
    <tr>

      <td>The best format for opening structured data (eg. As spreadsheets)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>XLS or XLSX</td>
      <td>Low</td>
      <td>Limits machine reading and use on non-Microsoft systems</td>
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
  <thead>
    <th colspan="3">Spatial</th>
    <tr>
      <th>File type</th>
      <th>Openness</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>KML</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>An open standard developed for Google Earth. May not translate to other systems. KMZ is also available as a packaged set of KML files.</td>

      <td>Standardised format for georeferenced map images</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

  <thead>
    <th colspan="3">Text</th>
    <tr>
      <th>File type</th>
      <th>Openness</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>TXT</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>Simple text format readable on most operating systems. No formatting is available</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>RTF</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>Simple text format readable on most operating systems which retains some formatting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ODT</td>
      <td>Medium</td>
      <td>Limits machine reading</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DOC or DOCX</td>
      <td>Low</td>
      <td>Limits machine reading and use on non-Microsoft systems</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PDF</td>
      <td>Low</td>
      <td>Useful for document exchange to preserve formatting, but has limitations for machine reading, character recognition and remixing.</td>
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Any **tabular** data should also be cleansed. This means that files should be:

  - raw - Presented in the simplest possible format with a single header row and
  - clean - Using uniform data formatting (eg; Numerical dates, postcodes in every field) with no missing entries, no embedded non-text information, data in every field and as few mistakes as possible

**Examples of raw, clean data**

      <th>Age</th>
      <th>Gender&lt;/thSchedule regular updatesupdates&gt;
      <th>Postcode</th>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;

                    <h3>Creating the Datasets</h3>
                

            <p>From the front page of the <a href="https://data.govt.nz">data.govt.nz</a> website, you’ll be able to see an <strong>Add Data</strong> button in the top right corner followed by <strong>Submit Dataset</strong> on the next page.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/publishing-data/02-submit.jpg" alt="data.govt.nz submission page" /></p>

<p>Your submission to data.govt.nz will a few pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dataset title</li>
  <li>A direct link to the dataset</li>
  <li>A description of the dataset</li>
  <li>The category it fits under</li>
  <li>The formats it is available is</li>
  <li>Re-use rights / license (<strong>See below</strong>)</li>
  <li>Update frequency (daily, monthly, yearly?)</li>
  <li>Title of the agency responsible for the dataset</li>
  <li>A contact email address (which will <strong>NOT</strong> be published)</li>
</ul>

                    <h3>Picking a license</h3>
                

            <p>Licensing is easily the most important aspect of releasing your dataset. It will determine whether or not your dataset can be used for a commercial purpose, publically redistributed and/or whether or not others have to provide attribution for your work.</p>

<p>For assistance in deciding, you may wish to consult the <a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/">NZGOAL framework</a> which provides guidance for agencies to follow when releasing copyright works and non-copyright material for re-use by others.</p>

<p>Once you’ve successfully uploaded your dataset, you should be able to see it live like so in the catalogue:</p>

                    <h3>Scheduling regular updates</h3>
                

            <p>It’s important to keep a schedule of how often the datasets you have provided are updated. Some datasets may not need updating very often but others, such as weekly gas prices, will be at their peak usefulness should they be updated in a timely manner.</p>

<p>For the example of gas prices, it wouldn’t make sense to only update the dataset once a month and interested users would likely look somewhere else for fresher data.</p>
